## 📖 Overview
This project analyzes historical data related to tobacco consumption and tobacco-attributable deaths. It performs exploratory data analysis, builds predictive models, and forecasts future mortality risk using a time-series forecasting model (ARIMA). The results provide insights for effective policymaking and public health intervention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze tobacco mortality trends using real datasets
- To visualize relationships between smoking behavior, affordability, and deaths
- To build machine learning models to predict mortality outcomes
- To forecast future mortality risk up to 2030
- To support health policy with data-driven evidence

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models
| Model | Purpose | Metrics |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Random Forest Regressor | Predict mortality outcomes | MAE, R² Score |
| Regression Models | Baseline comparison | Error based comparison |
| ARIMA Forecast | Time-series forecasting | Projected trend analysis |

---

## 📈 Forecast Interpretation
The ARIMA forecast indicates an **increasing mortality risk trend** for future years, suggesting that without stronger regulations and awareness campaigns, tobacco-related deaths are expected to rise. This highlights the urgent need for policy intervention and health measures.


## 📝 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a complete workflow of data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning analysis, and forecasting. The results show strong correlation between smoking prevalence, affordability of tobacco, and mortality risk. The forecasting predicts increasing risk in coming years, and policymakers must enforce preventive strategies to reduce deaths.
